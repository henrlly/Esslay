How to write an introduction:
[Hook] + [Link to topic] + Define (if needed) + [Stand]
Start off with a hook to capture the marker's attention. This is something interesting.
It may be slightly sensationalist, a major recent event, a historical anecdote, an apt
quote by a renowned individual, or if you are adept at language, a well-written piece
on today's state of affairs. Ultimately, aim to be unique and show you are at a tier
above the rest. An example used for the introduction should not be rewritten in the
body paragraphs.

Hook
Types of hook (not extensive)
- Historical event/information
- Significant current event
- Hyperbolic (sensationalist writing)
- Quote
- Myths, books and films (e.g. starting off an 'arts' essay with the Greek myth of
Orpheus, whose woeful singing following the death of Eurydice touched the
gods-even Hades, to link to your stand on the importance of the arts)
How to write an example as your hook (and not overlap with examples in body
paragraphs):
1. Use a historical example in your introduction; examples in your body
paragraphs need to be current anyway, so there is no overlap.
2. Use a general example that's related to the theme, but not directly to the
question. If the question is 'Discuss the view that most natural disasters are
the result of human activity,' the theme is clearly 'environment'. You can thus
start off your introduction with an example related to the environment (e.g. the
landmark signing of the Paris Agreement, the United States withdrawal from
it, or Trump's refusal to believe The National Climate Assessment Report).
3. Use an example that is not included in the question's scope. E.g. if the
question specifies 'in your society', use an example outside your society; if the
question specifies ''developed countries', use one from one of the developing
countries/ LDCs.
4. If you do have to repeat the example you used in your introduction (alongside
fresh examples) for a point in your body paragraph, consider using the word
'aforementioned' to call back to it.

Link hook to topic
(so that hook appears relevant to the topic): You need to transition from the hook to
the actual question. At the most basic level, this could be done using a rhetorical
question as follows. “(hook)...This takes us to a rather urgent question: has the
Trump administration truly blindfolded themselves from the ramifications of human
activity, or are their doubts in fact warranted? In this discourse, I shall expound on
why I resolutely believe that natural disasters, despite being naturally occurring as its
name suggests, is greatly exacerbated by man.”
Define (only when needed): You may want to state your own definition of
subjective/vague words in the question. If they are already obvious then it is
unnecessary to do so. E.g. 'developed country' may refer to those officially classified
by a government and the UN as developed, or your own definition of 'developed
countries' as simply those of high GDP per capita. Singapore, for instance, classifies
itself as a 'developing country', despite it often regarded as a 'developed country'.

Stand
A stand should be clear and well-qualified (if necessary). If the question is “is
regulation of the press desirable?”, the stand may be that “regulation of the press is
usually/not always undesirable/desirable”, or better put as “some regulation of the
press is usually desirable, but there are times when it is excessive and
objectionable”. It may also take the form of “X should be done unless Y”, where Y
would actually encompass your 'OV' (no rebuttal required). Another form is “A should
be done only when/as long as B”, where B would encompass your SVs. Your stand
does not have to be binary: it does not have to be a full agreement or full
disagreement; a middle-ground can be taken.
Even though a question may ask 'Discuss the view that most natural disasters are
the result of human activity,' you are free to highlight that human activity does not
necessarily cause these natural disasters, but do make them worse in terms of
frequency, intensity and predictability. This is a qualified stand. A non-qualified stand
may simply say 'human activity causes most natural disasters', which is technically
incorrect since natural disasters occur even without humans. Note that the word
'most' alone does not automatically make it a qualified stand. There is no need to
give blind 'yes' and 'no' answers especially when the question begins with 'Discuss'.
"""

CONCLUSION_GUIDE = """
How to write a conclusion:
A restatement of your stand, a general overview of your points discussed, and ending
off with an impactful statement (often a call to action) makes up a typical
conclusion. Quotes may also be used if apt. Avoid bringing forth anything new that
you did not validate in your body paragraphs.
How to write a high-level conclusion:
Cambridge’s markers’ report has explicitly stated that they like conclusions that link
back to the introduction. It stated that ‘a number of candidates refer back to their
introduction in a highly effective way, giving a sense of planning and organisation
based on sustained clarity of thought and argument. This is a technique worth
bearing in mind.’
A simple way to achieve this is to have an ‘uncertainty’ or rhetorical question in your
introduction, that you finally close/give an answer to in your conclusion. The answer
to an introduction’s rhetorical question may even be used to start off a conclusion
directly, sparing the need to use clichéd ways of doing so (e.g. ‘in conclusion’).
For example, an introduction that highlights the decisions made by the Trump
administration may have a conclusion that condemns these particular decisions by
the administration.

How to write body paragraphs
[Point] + [Example + Explanation]x2 or 3 + [Link]
Point
There is a strong preference for the point to be a reason rather than an area,
even for ‘to what extent’ and ‘how far’ questions. Even for questions that seem to be
expository in nature, it is encouraged that you use reason-oriented points. Even
essay questions like “In your society, how well are the demands of the economy and
the environment balanced?” need points that are reasons to why the demands of the
economy and environment are balanced/well-balanced. Notice how the ‘how’ in the
question is addressed by your essay’s stand, but your points are always reasons why
your stand is as such. In many questions, candidates are marked down for giving
area-driven points that are not reasons.
If the question specifies any condition, e.g. ‘when government finances are
limited’, ensure this is taken into account in your point. In this case, all your points
should be reasons related financial difficulty. E.g. “A country should still be allowed to
host international sporting events when her finances are limited as it provides an
opportunity to generate revenue it needs” or “A country should not be allowed to host
international sporting events when her finances are limited as it may be unable to
fund sufficient security for the event, making it a prime target of terrorist groups.”
Note: Addressing ‘How far is it’ and ‘To what extent’ only needs to done in the
stand in your introduction (e.g. to a large extent); they do not need to be repeated in
each topic sentence.

Can/Possible: reasons why there is ability to do so
Should/Justified: reasons–especially moral ones
Adequate: reasons why the situation is satisfactory at current level (if
adequate)/not satisfactory at current level (if inadequate)
Desirable: reasons why having it is attractive/useful/necessary (reasons why
we should have)
For COMPARISON questions (‘than’, ‘more’, ‘less’, ‘should A, not B’ etc.): for
each point, give a reason why A more/less than B in a particular aspect.
E.g. Human actions should be based on scientific fact (A), not religious faith (B), for the
former can be proven and eventually agreed upon, while the latter cannot and will remain
controversial, sowing discord.
E.g. The arts should focus on local talents (A) who can strengthen our national identity, rather
than foreign talent (B) which cannot do the same.
Elaboration
More often that not, one sentence of your point does not sufficiently explain
what you are saying. Add more details and explanations to strengthen your point.
Examples
Examples do not need to be statistics; they can be events or circumstances
that support your claim. If you want to show that Singapore has high quality
healthcare, you do not need to memorise a bunch of specific UN or WHO statistics
and reports. What you can write is something like this: “Singapore’s healthcare
system and medical expertise stands proudly on the international stage; this is
perhaps accentuated by foreign leaders, such as Robert Mugabe, who choose to
receive medical treatment in Singapore. Singapore was also the destination of choice
for treatment in several high profile emergencies, such as the 2012 Delhi gang rape
that shook a nation.”

Examples should be as relevant to the point made as possible. Two to three
examples are generally recommended per point. Similar examples may be grouped
together for evaluation at one go. To aid in brainstorming of examples, you may
consider the positive form and negative form. For the topic on the desirability of
competition, examples for a point may be that presence of competition between
Apple and Samsung led to constant progress in technological innovations, such as
the advent of facial and fingerprint recognition, virtual assistants, and augmented
reality; absence of competition between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the
United States has caused the U.S. to fall behind in internet speed rankings despite
her being its prime architect. For credibility, you may want to cite your sources.
Sometimes, in an examination, if you are unsure and really want to take a gamble,
just mention that the founder (insert name here) said it in an interview. In this case,
we could go with Andy Rubin (founder of Android OS) who did in fact talk about
cycles of innovation shifting in a saturated market. While you may ‘smoke’ some
news corporation as your source, do not over do this as it gets obvious. If you do, at
least use credible and believable sources. One way is to use sources specialised in
the area (e.g. PISA reports for questions related to education).
Examples should not be too broad; in the example above, one cannot stop at
mentioning that competition between Apple and Samsung led to greater
technological innovations—specific examples of these innovations should be
mentioned.
When reading articles, try to link it to useful topics-one example can often be
used for a multitude of themes, saving quite a bit of ‘memory space’. Here’s one we
most of you may know of: 2018’s incident where twelve young football boys and
their coach were tapped in a cave in Thailand. On the surface, it seems like there are
barely any topics you can use this for–but if you try to mentally link this to possible
topics, one example becomes many. Try doing that based on what you know about
the incident, then flip to the next page to see how many you got!

● Globalisation/Cooperation: the rescue team consisted of thirteen
international divers. The cave diving team included divers from U.K., Australia,
Denmark and many more.
● Businesses/Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Tesla chief Elon Musk
notably ordered two engineers to design a kid-sized submarine to aid in
rescue efforts (Technology), although this was rejected by the Thai
government. Some called this a publicity stunt.
● Media: The ordeal captured the media's attention from around the world. Over
a period of three weeks, articles relating to the incident dominated the top
stories section at many major news publications and many followed the news
closely via social media.
● Nationhood: Three of the boys and their coach were actually stateless, and
highlighted the plight of many stateless people in Thailand who come from
areas where national borders have changed, leaving their nationality in
question. They were granted citizenship after the ordeal.
● Sports: Even while trapped in the cave, the boys were asking for World Cup
updates, highlighting sports’ role as an entertainment source. Football players
and associations around the world voiced messages of support, such as FIFA,
the Japanese men’s national team, and Cristiano Ronaldo, proving that sports
unites people without boundaries.
● Religion: Amid uncertainty, many of those concerned about the lives of those
trapped were in prayer; religion has a role in giving at least temporary comfort.
After the rescue, eleven members of the football team were ordained as
Buddhist novices, a gesture to honour those who took part in their rescue. The
boys’ families had made the pledge to ordain the Wild Boars footballers to
show thanks for the efforts that went towards saving them and also to pay
respect to the Thai navy Seal, Saman Kunan, who died in the rescue operation.
A list of useful examples per theme can be found under the ‘content’ section.

Link
The Cambridge Examiners’ report (which can be found at this online source)
stated that “the closing sentence should leave the Examiner firmly convinced of its
logical development. Whilst many do this, others rely on a formulaic repetition of the
wording of the question, irrespective of its link to what has gone before.”
